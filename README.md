> Resilience is not a feature. It is a behavior learned under stress.

chaos-labs is a hands-on lab for **intentionally breaking systems** in order to understand them, harden them, and operate them with confidence.

This repository exists because:
- Reliability discovered in production is too late
- Dashboards without failure context lie
- “It should be fine” is not an engineering strategy

## Core beliefs

- **Failure is inevitable** — pretending otherwise creates fragile systems
- **Confidence comes from exposure**, not documentation
- **Automation without understanding amplifies risk**
- **Resilience must be exercised**, not reviewed in design docs

If you’re looking for polished frameworks or vendor-neutral platitudes, this is not that repo.

## What lives here

This is a working lab, not a library.


Everything here exists for one reason:  
**to reduce surprise when things break for real.**

## How to use this repo

- Run experiments in **non-production environments**
- Read patterns as **contextual guidance**, not universal truth
- Steal ideas, adapt aggressively, discard what doesn’t fit

This repo favors **clarity over completeness** and **learning over safety theater**.

## Non-goals

- Generic “best practices”
- Vendor marketing abstractions
- One-size-fits-all architectures
- Chaos for chaos’ sake

Breaking things without learning is just noise.

## Status

🚧 Actively evolving.  
Expect strong opinions, incomplete edges, and iteration.
