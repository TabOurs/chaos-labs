# chaos-labs

> Experiments, tooling, and patterns for resilience engineering, automation, and controlled chaos.

## Why chaos-labs exists

Modern systems fail in complex, non-obvious ways.  
chaos-labs is a hands-on lab for exploring:

- Resilience engineering
- Failure testing and chaos experiments
- Platform automation (Kubernetes, CI/CD, cloud)
- SRE & operational maturity patterns
- AI-assisted operations and developer productivity

This repo evolves as experiments become tools, and tools become reusable patterns.

## Repository structure (evolving)
🚧 Early-stage, actively evolving.

## Status

🚧 Early-stage, actively evolving.

Expect:
- Incomplete experiments
- Opinionated approaches
- Iterative refinement

## How to engage
